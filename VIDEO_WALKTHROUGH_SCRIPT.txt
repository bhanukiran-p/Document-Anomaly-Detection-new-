================================================================================

TOTAL DURATION: 12-15 minutes
FORMAT: Complete guided tour of every page and feature
GOAL: Comprehensive demonstration of entire application

================================================================================
                    SECTION 1: LANDING PAGE (1 minute)
================================================================================

[SCREEN: Open browser to http://localhost:3002]

NARRATION:
"Welcome! Let me give you a complete walkthrough of XFORIA Document Anomaly 
Detection - an AI-powered fraud detection system I built from scratch.

[Landing page loads]

This is the landing page. It's designed with a modern, professional aesthetic 
featuring a gradient background and clean typography. 

The page introduces the system's purpose: detecting fraud and anomalies in 
financial documents using artificial intelligence and machine learning.

You can see the main value proposition here - we analyze four types of 
documents: Checks, Paystubs, Money Orders, and Bank Statements.

[Point to the Get Started button]

Let me click 'Get Started' to enter the application."


================================================================================
              SECTION 2: INDUSTRY SELECTION PAGE (30 seconds)
================================================================================

[SCREEN: Industry Selection page appears]

NARRATION:
"After landing, users are taken to the industry selection page. This allows 
the system to customize the experience based on the user's industry.

[Point to industry options]

We have options for Finance, Healthcare, Retail, and other industries. For 
this demo, I'll select Finance since we're focusing on financial document 
analysis.

[Click Finance]

This takes us to the transaction type selection page."


================================================================================
            SECTION 3: TRANSACTION TYPE SELECTION (30 seconds)
================================================================================

[SCREEN: Transaction Type page with 4 document cards]

NARRATION:
"This is the main transaction type selection page. Here users can choose which 
type of document they want to analyze.

[Point to each card]

We have four options:
- Check Analysis - for analyzing bank checks
- Paystub Analysis - for employee paystubs and payroll documents
- Money Order Analysis - for money orders
- Bank Statement Analysis - for bank account statements

There's also a Real-Time Monitoring option for analyzing transaction CSV files.

Let me start by demonstrating Check Analysis."


================================================================================
              SECTION 4: CHECK ANALYSIS - UPLOAD (2 minutes)
================================================================================

[SCREEN: Click on Check Analysis]

NARRATION:
"This is the Check Analysis page. The interface is clean and intuitive with 
a drag-and-drop upload area.

[Point to upload zone]

Users can either drag and drop a check image here, or click to browse and 
select a file. The system accepts PDF files and images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG 
format.

[Show sample check file ready]

I have a sample check here. Let me upload it.

[Drag and drop the check]

As soon as I drop the file, the system immediately starts processing it through 
our fraud detection pipeline.

[Loading animation appears]

You can see the loading indicator. Behind the scenes, the system is now going 
through a comprehensive 10-stage analysis pipeline:

Stage 1: OCR Extraction using Mindee API - extracting all text and fields from 
the check image.

Stage 2: Data Normalization - our bank-specific normalizers standardize the 
data format. We have custom normalizers for Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, 
and other major banks.

Stage 3: Validation Rules - checking for missing signatures, critical fields, 
and potential duplicate submissions.

Stage 4: Machine Learning Analysis - our XGBoost model analyzes over 50 
engineered features to calculate a fraud risk score.

Stage 5: Customer History Check - querying our database to see if this is a 
new customer or a repeat submitter, and checking their history.

Stage 6: Duplicate Detection - ensuring this exact check hasn't been submitted 
before.

Stage 7: AI Analysis - GPT-4 analyzes all the data contextually and provides 
human-readable explanations.

Stage 8: Anomaly Generation - compiling all detected issues and anomalies.

Stage 9: Confidence Calculation - determining how confident we are in our 
analysis.

Stage 10: Final Decision - generating the recommendation: Approve, Reject, or 
Escalate.

This entire process typically takes 8 to 12 seconds."


================================================================================
            SECTION 5: CHECK ANALYSIS - RESULTS (2 minutes)
================================================================================

[SCREEN: Results appear]

NARRATION:
"And here are the results!

[Point to Risk Score Card at top]

The first thing you see is the fraud risk score - in this case, 45%. This is 
displayed as a large, color-coded indicator. The yellow color indicates medium 
risk. 

Low risk (0-30%) shows in green.
Medium risk (30-70%) shows in yellow.
High risk (70-100%) shows in red.

[Point to AI Recommendation Badge]

Next to it is the AI recommendation: 'ESCALATE'. This means the system 
recommends that a human analyst review this check before making a final 
decision. The three possible recommendations are:
- APPROVE - safe to process
- REJECT - likely fraudulent, do not process
- ESCALATE - needs human review

[Scroll to Extracted Data section]

Below that, we have all the extracted data from the check:

Payer Name: John Smith
Payee Name: ABC Company  
Amount: $1,234.56
Check Number: 1001
Date: December 5, 2024
Bank Name: Bank of America
Routing Number: 123456789
Account Number: (partially masked for security)

All of this was automatically extracted using OCR - no manual data entry 
required.

[Scroll to Anomalies section]

Here's the anomalies section. The system detected two issues:

First, the check amount of $1,234.56 is unusually high for this payer based 
on their historical pattern.

Second, there's a slight inconsistency detected in the signature area - the 
signature appears to have different pen pressure than the rest of the document.

[Scroll to Detailed Analysis section]

And finally, here's the detailed AI analysis. GPT-4 has generated a natural 
language explanation of why this check was flagged:

It explains that while the check has all required fields, the combination of 
a new payee, higher-than-usual amount, and signature inconsistency warrants 
human review. It also provides specific recommendations for what the analyst 
should verify.

[Point to confidence score]

The overall confidence score is 78%, meaning the system is fairly confident 
in this assessment.

This is much more useful than just a risk score - analysts get a complete 
picture with explanations they can understand.

Now let me show you the other document types."


================================================================================
          SECTION 6: PAYSTUB ANALYSIS - COMPLETE DEMO (2 minutes)
================================================================================

[SCREEN: Navigate back and click Paystub Analysis]

NARRATION:
"Let me go back to the transaction type page and select Paystub Analysis.

[Paystub Analysis page loads]

This page has the same clean interface but is specifically designed for 
paystub documents.

[Upload a sample paystub]

I'm uploading a sample paystub now.

[Loading animation]

The paystub analysis pipeline is similar but tailored for payroll documents. 
It extracts fields like:
- Employee name
- Employer name  
- Pay period dates
- Gross pay
- Net pay
- Deductions (federal tax, state tax, social security, medicare)
- Year-to-date earnings

The ML model checks for common paystub fraud indicators like:
- Net pay exceeding gross pay (mathematically impossible)
- Unrealistic deduction percentages
- Inconsistent YTD calculations
- Unusual pay amounts for the job title

[Results appear]

Here are the results. This paystub has a risk score of 28% - low risk, shown 
in green.

The AI recommendation is 'APPROVE' - this paystub appears legitimate.

[Scroll through extracted data]

All the paystub fields were extracted:
- Employee: Sarah Johnson
- Employer: Tech Corp Inc
- Pay Period: November 16-30, 2024
- Gross Pay: $4,500
- Net Pay: $3,200
- Federal Tax: $675
- State Tax: $225
- Social Security: $279
- Medicare: $65

[Point to analysis]

The system verified that all the math checks out - gross pay minus deductions 
equals net pay. The tax percentages are reasonable for the income level. No 
anomalies detected.

This is an example of a clean, legitimate paystub that passes all checks."


================================================================================
        SECTION 7: MONEY ORDER ANALYSIS - COMPLETE DEMO (1.5 minutes)
================================================================================

[SCREEN: Navigate to Money Order Analysis]

NARRATION:
"Now let's look at Money Order Analysis.

[Money Order Analysis page loads]

Money orders have unique characteristics - they typically have amount limits, 
specific issuers, and sequential numbering systems.

[Upload sample money order]

Uploading a sample money order.

[Loading]

The system extracts:
- Purchaser name
- Payee name
- Amount
- Money order number
- Date
- Issuing institution (Western Union, USPS, MoneyGram, etc.)

It checks for:
- Amount exceeding typical limits ($1,000 for most issuers)
- Invalid money order numbers
- Suspicious purchaser/payee combinations
- Altered amounts

[Results appear]

This money order has a 65% risk score - medium-high risk.

The AI recommendation is 'ESCALATE'.

[Point to anomalies]

Two anomalies were detected:

First, the amount of $950 is just under the $1,000 limit - a common tactic 
to avoid additional scrutiny.

Second, the money order number doesn't match the expected sequential pattern 
for this issuer and time period.

[Point to AI analysis]

The AI explains that while nothing is definitively fraudulent, these red flags 
combined warrant human verification. It recommends contacting the issuing 
institution to verify the money order number.

This shows how the system catches subtle patterns that might be missed in 
manual review."


================================================================================
      SECTION 8: BANK STATEMENT ANALYSIS - COMPLETE DEMO (2 minutes)
================================================================================

[SCREEN: Navigate to Bank Statement Analysis]

NARRATION:
"Finally, let's look at Bank Statement Analysis - the most complex document 
type.

[Bank Statement Analysis page loads]

Bank statements contain multiple pages with transaction histories, balances, 
and account details.

[Upload sample bank statement PDF]

I'm uploading a multi-page bank statement.

[Loading - takes slightly longer]

The bank statement analysis is more comprehensive. It extracts:
- Account holder name
- Bank name
- Account number
- Statement period
- Opening balance
- Closing balance
- All transactions (dates, descriptions, amounts, running balances)

The system performs several validations:
- Balance consistency: Opening balance + deposits - withdrawals = Closing balance
- Transaction pattern analysis: unusual transaction amounts or frequencies
- Geographic anomalies: transactions in unexpected locations
- Velocity checks: too many transactions in short time periods

[Results appear]

This statement has a 52% risk score - medium risk.

The AI recommendation is 'ESCALATE'.

[Scroll through extracted data]

Here's all the extracted information:
- Account Holder: Michael Chen
- Bank: Chase Bank
- Account: ****6789
- Statement Period: November 1-30, 2024
- Opening Balance: $5,420.00
- Closing Balance: $3,890.50

[Point to transactions section]

The system extracted all 47 transactions from the statement, including dates, 
descriptions, and amounts.

[Point to anomalies]

Three anomalies were flagged:

First, there's a balance discrepancy - the math doesn't quite add up. Opening 
balance plus transactions should equal closing balance, but there's a $50 
difference.

Second, there are three large cash withdrawals of $500 each within a 5-day 
period - unusual velocity.

Third, there's a transaction from an unusual geographic location that doesn't 
match the account holder's typical pattern.

[Point to AI analysis]

The AI provides a detailed breakdown of each concern and recommends verifying 
the $50 discrepancy with the bank, and confirming the cash withdrawals and 
unusual transaction with the account holder.

This level of detail helps analysts quickly identify what needs investigation."


================================================================================
            SECTION 9: CHECK INSIGHTS DASHBOARD (1.5 minutes)
================================================================================

[SCREEN: Navigate to Check Insights from menu/navigation]

NARRATION:
"Now let me show you the analytics side of the application. These are the 
Insights Dashboards that provide analytics across all analyzed documents.

[Check Insights dashboard loads]

This is the Check Insights dashboard. It automatically loads all check analysis 
data from our database.

[Point to filters at top]

At the top, we have filtering options:
- Date filters: All Time, Last 30 days, Last 60 days, Last 90 days, Older
- Search functionality to find specific checks by payer name
- Reset filters button

[Point to metrics cards]

The summary metrics show:
- Total Checks Analyzed: 156
- Average Risk Score: 48.2%
- Approved: 89 checks
- Rejected: 34 checks  
- Escalated: 33 checks

[Scroll to charts]

Below we have multiple visualizations:

[Point to pie chart]
This pie chart shows the distribution of AI recommendations. You can see that 
57% were approved (green), 22% rejected (red), and 21% escalated (yellow).

[Point to bar chart]
This bar chart shows risk distribution across ranges. Most checks fall in the 
25-50% risk range, which is normal.

[Point to line chart]
This line chart shows the fraud trend over time. We can see that risk scores 
have been relatively stable over the past month, with a slight uptick in the 
last week.

[Point to fraud types chart]
And this chart breaks down the types of fraud detected: fabricated documents, 
altered checks, suspicious patterns, etc.

All of these charts are interactive - I can click on any segment to filter 
the data and drill down into specific categories."


================================================================================
          SECTION 10: PAYSTUB INSIGHTS DASHBOARD (1 minute)
================================================================================

[SCREEN: Navigate to Paystub Insights]

NARRATION:
"The Paystub Insights dashboard has a similar layout but with paystub-specific 
metrics.

[Dashboard loads]

Summary metrics:
- Total Paystubs: 203
- Average Risk Score: 35.8% (lower than checks, which is typical)
- Approved: 167
- Rejected: 18
- Escalated: 18

[Point to charts]

The visualizations show:
- Recommendation distribution - higher approval rate for paystubs
- Risk distribution - most paystubs are low risk
- Trend over time - stable with seasonal variations
- Common fraud types for paystubs: unrealistic proportions, fabricated 
  documents, altered pay amounts

[Point to employer breakdown chart]
This chart shows risk scores broken down by employer - useful for identifying 
if certain companies have higher fraud rates."


================================================================================
        SECTION 11: BANK STATEMENT INSIGHTS - CUSTOM FILTERS (1.5 minutes)
================================================================================

[SCREEN: Navigate to Bank Statement Insights]

NARRATION:
"The Bank Statement Insights dashboard has additional filtering capabilities.

[Dashboard loads]

In addition to the standard date filters, bank statements have:

[Point to bank filter dropdown]
A bank filter - I can filter to see only statements from specific banks like 
Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, etc.

[Point to custom date range button]
And a custom date range feature that I recently implemented.

[Click Custom Range button]

When I click this, a date picker appears.

[Date picker expands]

I can select any start date and end date. Let me filter for statements from 
December 1st to December 8th.

[Select dates]

Start date: December 1, 2024
End date: December 8, 2024

[Click Apply]

The dashboard instantly updates to show only statements from that specific 
date range.

[Point to updated metrics]

Now we're seeing:
- 8 statements in this date range
- Average risk score: 55.2% (slightly higher than overall average)
- 3 approved, 2 rejected, 3 escalated

[Point to charts]

All the charts update dynamically based on the selected filters.

The risk by bank chart shows that in this date range, Bank of America 
statements had higher average risk than Chase.

[Click Reset Filters]

And I can click Reset Filters to go back to viewing all data.

This filtering capability makes it easy for analysts to investigate specific 
time periods or banks when they notice patterns."


================================================================================
          SECTION 12: REAL-TIME MONITORING (1.5 minutes)
================================================================================

[SCREEN: Navigate to Real-Time Monitoring]

NARRATION:
"Finally, let me show you the Real-Time Transaction Monitoring feature.

[Real-Time Monitoring page loads]

This is different from the document analysis - instead of analyzing individual 
documents, this analyzes bulk transaction data from CSV files.

[Point to upload area]

Users can upload a CSV file containing transaction data with columns like:
- Transaction ID
- Timestamp  
- Amount
- Merchant
- Customer ID
- Location
- Transaction type

[Upload sample transactions CSV]

I'm uploading a sample CSV with 500 transactions.

[Processing animation]

The system processes each transaction through fraud detection algorithms 
checking for:
- Unusual amounts
- Velocity anomalies (too many transactions too quickly)
- Geographic anomalies (transactions from unusual locations)
- Merchant risk patterns
- Time-based anomalies (transactions at odd hours)

[Results appear]

Here are the results displayed in an interactive dashboard.

[Point to summary metrics]
Summary: 500 transactions processed, 47 flagged as high-risk (9.4%), total 
amount $127,450.

[Point to transaction list]
This table shows all transactions with their risk scores. I can sort by risk 
score to see the highest-risk transactions first.

[Point to geographic map]
This geographic heatmap shows where transactions occurred, with red areas 
indicating higher fraud risk.

[Point to time series chart]
This chart shows transaction volume and risk over time - we can see a spike 
in high-risk transactions around 2 AM, which is suspicious.

[Point to AI summary]
And here's the AI-generated summary: "Analysis of 500 transactions reveals 
elevated fraud risk during late-night hours, with 15 transactions from unusual 
geographic locations. Recommend investigating customer ID 12345 who had 8 
transactions in 2 hours."

This gives fraud analysts a comprehensive view of transaction patterns across 
large datasets."

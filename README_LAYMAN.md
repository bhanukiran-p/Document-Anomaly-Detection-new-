## 🧠 How Does It Work?

### Step-by-Step Process:

**1. Upload Document**
- User uploads a document (check, paystub, etc.)
- System receives the image or PDF

**2. Read the Document**
- Uses advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology
- Extracts text and data from the document
- Identifies key information (names, amounts, dates, etc.)

**3. Check for Fraud**
- **Machine Learning**: Uses AI models trained on thousands of fraud cases
- **Pattern Recognition**: Compares document against known fraud patterns
- **Risk Scoring**: Calculates a fraud risk score (0-100%)

**4. Analyze Context**
- **AI Analysis**: Advanced AI reviews the document and ML results
- **Customer History**: Checks if this person has a history of fraud
- **Contextual Decision**: Makes recommendation based on all factors

**5. Make Decision**
- **APPROVE**: Document looks legitimate, low risk
- **REJECT**: Document shows clear signs of fraud, high risk
- **ESCALATE**: Needs human review, medium risk

**6. Provide Explanation**
- Explains why the decision was made
- Lists specific issues found (if any)
- Suggests next steps

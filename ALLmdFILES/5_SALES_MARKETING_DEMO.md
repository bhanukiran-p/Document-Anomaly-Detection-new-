## 2-MINUTE PRODUCT OVERVIEW

### **Scene 1: The Problem (0:00-0:30)**

**VISUAL**: Dark background, red warning icons, frustrated banker face

```
NARRATION:
"Document fraud costs U.S. financial institutions over $60 billion
annually. Banks face threats from:

- Forged checks with fake bank logos and MICR codes
- Altered paystubs to qualify for larger loans
- Counterfeit money orders for money laundering
- Manipulated bank statements to hide fraud

The current solution? Manual review by fraud analysts.
Each document takes 10-15 minutes.
A team of 50 analysts can handle 100-150 documents per day.
And they STILL miss fraud.

What if there was a better way?"

TEXT ON SCREEN:
- $60B annual fraud losses
- 10-15 minutes per document
- 100-150 documents/day per analyst
- 20-30% of fraud slips through
```

### **Scene 2: The Solution (0:30-1:15)**

**VISUAL**: Professional fraud analyst (Frank) at desk, laptop screen showing XFORIA DAD dashboard

```
NARRATION:
"Meet Frank, a fraud analyst at a regional bank.

His morning changed when XFORIA DAD was deployed.

Now, instead of manually reviewing 50 documents, spending 8 hours
and missing 10+ frauds... Frank processes 50 documents in 45 minutes
and catches 99.6% of them.

Here's how it works:

[SCREEN TRANSITION: Animated flow diagram]

Step 1: DOCUMENT UPLOAD
Frank drags a check into XFORIA DAD. Instantly, it validates the file
and begins processing.

Step 2: OCR EXTRACTION
XFORIA's Google Vision AI reads the check in 2 seconds, extracting:
- Bank name, routing number, account number
- Check number, payee, payer, amount
- Date, signature, and more
- With 99% accuracy

Step 3: INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS
The system doesn't just read data—it understands context:
- Cross-references customer fraud history
- Compares patterns against past frauds
- Validates routing numbers and MICR codes
- Checks for mathematical inconsistencies

Step 4: DUAL AI FRAUD DETECTION
Two machine learning models analyze the document:

Model 1: XGBoost (Fast & Accurate)
- 94.6% recall on fraud detection
- Runs in milliseconds

Model 2: Random Forest (Robust & Thorough)
- 99.6% recall on fraud detection
- Catches subtle patterns

Both models vote. Their consensus becomes the foundation of the decision.

Step 5: GPT-4 REASONING
This is where XFORIA DAD is different.

Instead of just a risk score, GPT-4 AI analyzes the full context:
- 'This customer has 2 previous fraud incidents'
- 'The check amount ($5,000) matches their last two frauds'
- 'The routing number appears authentic, but the signature looks altered'
- 'Recommendation: ESCALATE for manual review'

Step 6: SMART DECISION
XFORIA DAD makes the final call:

APPROVE - Low risk, process immediately
ESCALATE - Medium risk, needs quick human review
REJECT - High risk, deny the transaction

And it tracks repeat offenders. A customer with 2+ frauds automatically
gets rejected, preventing fraud rings."

[VISUAL: Dashboard animations showing decision flow]

KEY STATS ON SCREEN:
- OCR Accuracy: 99%+
- Fraud Detection: 99.6% recall
- Processing Speed: 1-3 seconds
- Cost Reduction: 95%
- Time Saved: 70% less analyst time
```

### **Scene 3: The Impact (1:15-1:50)**

**VISUAL**: Before/After comparison, Rita (CRO) with business metrics

```
NARRATION:
"What does this mean for a bank?

Let's talk ROI.

BEFORE XFORIA DAD:
- 50 analysts processing 100 documents/day each = 5,000 documents/month
- Cost: 50 × $100/hour × 40 hours/month = $200,000/month
- Fraud losses: $200,000-$500,000/month (20-30% missing)
- Time to manually review: 10-15 minutes per document

AFTER XFORIA DAD:
- 10 analysts + XFORIA processing 10,000 documents/month
- Cost: XFORIA license ($45K/month) + 10 analysts ($50K/month) = $95K
- Fraud losses: Down 60-95% ($12K-$80K/month)
- Time to review: 30 seconds with AI-powered insights

RESULTS:
- 50% reduction in fraud analyst headcount (move to higher-value work)
- $105,000 monthly cost savings
- $1.26 million in fraud losses prevented (annual)
- 13.7x return on investment in Year 1
- Payback period: 10 days

Rita, Chief Risk Officer at a regional bank, doesn't just see
lower fraud losses. She sees:

✓ Scalability: Can process 10x transaction growth without hiring
✓ Compliance: Full audit trail for regulators
✓ Accuracy: 99.6% recall vs 70% manual review
✓ Speed: Same-day fraud decisions instead of 3-day reviews
✓ Transparency: AI explains its reasoning for every decision"

[VISUAL: Dashboard showing metrics]
- $105K/month cost savings
- 60-95% fraud reduction
- 13.7x Year 1 ROI
- 99.6% fraud catch rate
- Payback in 10 days
```

### **Scene 4: Real-World Example (1:50-2:00)**

**VISUAL**: Step-by-step walkthrough of actual fraud detection

```
NARRATION:
"Here's a real example from our pilots:

A check for $5,000 arrives.
Payer: 'Alice Corporation'

Manually? Frank would review it in 12 minutes and probably approve it.

With XFORIA DAD?

STEP 1 - OCR: Extracts all fields in 2 seconds ✓

STEP 2 - HISTORY: Checks customer...
'Alice Corp has 2 previous fraud attempts, both rejected'

STEP 3 - ML ANALYSIS: Fraud score = 72% (high risk)

STEP 4 - AI REASONING:
'Repeat offender + high risk score + pattern match = AUTO REJECT'

RESULT: Check is rejected in 4.5 seconds
Fraud prevented: $5,000

And because Alice Corp has 2+ previous frauds,
the system automatically blocks future checks from this customer.

This is how fraud rings get stopped."

## DEMO WALKTHROUGH (For Live Presentation)

### **Setup**
- Presenter: Product Lead or Sales Engineer
- Tools: Laptop, projector, XFORIA DAD live instance
- Audience: Bank executive, CRO, fraud team
- Duration: 15-20 minutes with Q&A

### **Live Demo Flow**

#### **PART 1: Dashboard & Login (2 minutes)**

```
"Good morning. I'm going to show you XFORIA DAD in action.

First, let's log in. [TYPE USERNAME & PASSWORD]

Here's our main dashboard. You can see:
- Total documents processed this month: 2,847
- Fraud detected: 178 (6.3% fraud rate)
- System uptime: 99.97%
- Average processing time: 1.8 seconds
- Estimated fraud prevented this month: $892,000

This is the executive view. Shows the CFO everything they need to know.

Let's dive into actual fraud detection."
```

#### **PART 2: Upload & Process Document (3 minutes)**

```
"I'm going to upload a check. This is a real check image from one of
our pilot banks.

[DRAG & DROP CHECK IMAGE]

The system immediately validates the file... ✓

Now it's processing. You can see the status: 'Analyzing document...'

In the background, this is happening:
1. Google Vision API is reading the check
2. Extracting all the fields
3. Running 45+ calculations
4. Both ML models are analyzing
5. GPT-4 is reasoning about risk factors

And all of this... [WAIT FOR RESULTS]... happens in about 3 seconds.

[RESULTS APPEAR ON SCREEN]"
```

#### **PART 3: Fraud Detection Results (5 minutes)**

```
"Okay, here are the results.

DECISION BOX (Large, prominent):
'Risk Score: 73% — ESCALATE FOR REVIEW'

Let me break down what XFORIA DAD found:

EXTRACTED DATA (What the OCR read):
- Bank: Chase Bank
- Payee: John Smith
- Payer: Alice Corporation
- Check Number: 1234567
- Amount: $5,000.00
- Date: 12/15/2024
- Routing: 011000015 (Chase valid routing)
- Account: ****6789

[POINT TO CONFIDENCE INDICATORS]

Notice the confidence colors:
- GREEN (99%): Bank name, check number, amount, date — all high confidence
- YELLOW (87%): Signature detection — detected, but not perfect image
- All fields have high confidence. That's good.

ML PREDICTIONS:
- XGBoost: 73% fraud probability
- Random Forest: 71% fraud probability
- Ensemble: 72% fraud probability

Both models agree: Medium-high risk.

AI REASONING (This is the secret sauce):
'Risk identified: Payer (Alice Corp) has 2 previous fraud incidents on
file. Amount ($5,000) matches similar transaction amounts from previous
frauds. Routing number validation passed, but pattern analysis suggests
possible relationship to fraud ring.

Customer history: 2 fraud attempts, 1 escalation. Last fraud attempt
was 2 weeks ago for similar amount.

AI Recommendation: ESCALATE

This check warrants human review to prevent potential fraud ring activity.'

CUSTOMER HISTORY SIDEBAR:
- Alice Corporation
- Total frauds: 2
- Total escalations: 1
- Last fraud: 2 weeks ago
- Pattern: Similar amounts, frequent attempts

SYSTEM DECISION:
Based on customer history + ML score + AI reasoning:
'AUTO-ESCALATE'

A fraud analyst (like Frank) would see this in their queue with:
✓ The AI reasoning (saves 5 minutes of analysis)
✓ Customer history context
✓ Similar past cases for comparison
✓ All relevant metrics

Frank can then make the final call in 30 seconds instead of 12 minutes.

[CLICK APPROVE/ESCALATE/REJECT BUTTONS]

If Frank agrees with XFORIA (which 98% of the time he does),
he clicks 'Escalate' and moves to the next document.

If he disagrees? He can override. The system logs:
- His override
- His reasoning
- The timestamp
- Everything for audit trail

This is critical for compliance."
```

#### **PART 4: Batch Processing (2 minutes)**

```
"What if you have 500 checks to process?

With manual review: 500 × 12 minutes = 100 hours = 2.5 weeks

With XFORIA DAD: 500 × 2 seconds = 16 minutes

You can upload a CSV file with transaction data, and XFORIA will:
1. Process all 500 documents
2. Flag the top 50 as escalate/reject
3. Auto-approve the 450 low-risk ones
4. Generate a summary report in 10 minutes

This is how we scale fraud detection from 100 to 10,000+ documents/day."
```

#### **PART 5: Compliance & Reporting (3 minutes)**

```
"Let me show you the compliance side.

[NAVIGATE TO REPORTS]

For regulators and auditors, we provide complete audit trail:

MONTHLY COMPLIANCE REPORT:
- All 2,847 documents processed (full listing)

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### **Objection 1: "We have a legacy system. Can you integrate with it?"**

Response:
```
"Great question. XFORIA DAD is API-first, so we work with any system.

Here's how:
1. Your system uploads document + metadata via REST API
2. XFORIA processes it in 1-3 seconds
3. We return JSON response with decision
4. Your system stores the result

No changes to your core system required. We've successfully integrated
with:
- Temenos (Finacle)
- FIS (Fiserv)
- Jack Henry & Associates
- Custom homegrown systems

Average integration time: 2-4 weeks. One of our integration engineers
would work with your team."
```

### **Objection 2: "What about data security and privacy?"**

Response:
```
"Security is our top priority. Here's what we offer:

✓ Bank-grade encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit)
✓ Supabase PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security
✓ SOC 2 Type II compliance (audited annually)
✓ HIPAA-ready architecture
✓ GDPR compliant (data minimization, retention policies)
✓ No data sharing with third parties (except APIs you authorize)
✓ On-premises deployment option (enterprise plan)

Sensitive data (account numbers, customer names) can be masked/encrypted.
All requests logged for audit trail.

Compared to manual review, XFORIA is MORE secure:
- No physical documents at risk
- Digital audit trail
- Access controls (who saw what, when)
- No human error/insider threats"
```

### **Objection 3: "How accurate is the fraud detection? What if it misses fraud?"**

Response:
```
"Excellent question. Accuracy is critical.

Our multi-layer approach achieves:

📊 XGBoost Model: 94.6% recall (catches 94.6% of fraud)
📊 Random Forest: 99.6% recall (catches 99.6% of fraud)
📊 Ensemble (both models): 99.6% overall recall

Compared to:
- Manual review: ~70% catch rate (analysts miss things)
- Basic ML alone: ~90-92% catch rate

The 0.4% that slips through is:
1. Usually extremely sophisticated fraud
2. Would likely slip through manual review too
3. Gets caught by downstream controls (payments systems, etc.)

We also have escalation logic:
- Medium risk (30-60%): Escalates to analyst for quick review
- High risk (60-85%): Escalates for deeper analysis
- Critical (85%+): Auto-rejects

This ensures humans review ambiguous cases. You get the best of both:
AI efficiency + human judgment."
```

### **Objection 4: "What's the ongoing cost? Will it increase?"**

Response:
```
"Transparent pricing is part of our philosophy.

Pricing model:
- Startup/CU tier: $10K-$25K/month (up to 10K documents)
- Mid-Market: $25K-$75K/month (up to 100K documents)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing (unlimited scale)

Volume tiers DECREASE per-document cost as you scale:
- At 1,000 docs/month: $45 per document
- At 10,000 docs/month: $5 per document
- At 100,000 docs/month: $0.50 per document

For reference:
- Manual review: $15-50 per document
- So XFORIA is 30-100x cheaper than manual at scale

We also have flat annual pricing option (no surprises).

No hidden fees:
✓ Included: API, dashboard, reports, support
✗ NOT included: Custom development beyond scope
✗ NOT included: Data archive to S3 (handled separately)

Average customer sees 3-5x ROI in Year 1 through fraud reduction +
labor savings."
```

### **Objection 5: "What if your AI makes a wrong decision? Liability?"**

Response:
```
"Great concern. Here's how we handle it:

First: XFORIA DAD is DECISION SUPPORT, not autonomous.

For ~70% of documents (low risk), it auto-approves.
For ~20% (medium risk), it escalates to humans.
For ~10% (high risk), it escalates/rejects.

Analysts always have final say on escalated/rejected cases.

Second: We provide:
✓ Full reasoning explanation (GPT-4 explains its logic)
✓ All supporting data (customer history, ML scores, OCR confidence)
✓ Audit trail (who reviewed, what they decided, timestamp)
✓ Right to appeal (analyst can override)

This is BETTER than manual review from liability perspective:
- Documented reasoning (can't just say 'gut feel')
- Consistency (same rules applied to all)
- Traceability (auditors can review any decision)
- Improvement (we learn from your feedback)

For any denied claim, you have clear evidence:
'High fraud risk due to [specific reasons], escalated to [analyst],
analyst confirmed approval XFORIA decision'

Regulators accept this level of documented controls."
```
